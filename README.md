# Henshin Interpreter (repackaged for Maven)
This repository contains the version 1.4.0 of the [Henshin](https://www.eclipse.org/henshin) interpreter. We used Gradle here to repackage the library (with source and javadoc jars) for maven and to publish it to Maven central. We need the interpreter not only within Eclipse but within our standalone library as well.

The original source repo: https://git.eclipse.org/c/henshin/org.eclipse.emft.henshin.git/
